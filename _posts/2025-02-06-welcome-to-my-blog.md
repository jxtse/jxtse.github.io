## Hello World!

Welcome to my personal blog! I'm excited to share my thoughts, research insights, and experiences directly on this website.

### What to Expect

In this blog, I'll be writing about:

- **AI Research**: Deep dives into Large Language Models (LLMs), Natural Language Processing (NLP), and cutting-edge AI technologies.
- **Technical Tutorials**: Practical guides on implementing AI solutions, from prompt engineering to model fine-tuning.
- **Research Journey**: My experiences as a graduate student at Nanjing University and insights from my internships at Microsoft and other institutions.
- **Life & Thoughts**: Reflections on the intersection of technology and humanity.

### Why Host Blog Posts Here?

While I continue to write on platforms like WeChat Public Account, Xiaohongshu, and Medium, having blog posts directly on my personal website allows me to:

1. **Full Control**: Complete ownership of my content and presentation.
2. **Better Integration**: Seamless integration with my research and project pages.
3. **No Platform Limitations**: Freedom to format and structure content as I see fit.

### Stay Connected

Feel free to explore my other blog posts, check out my publications, or reach out through the contact information on the sidebar. I'm always happy to connect with fellow researchers and enthusiasts!
